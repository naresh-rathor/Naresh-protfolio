          I was highly impressed with Naresh's attitude and efficiency during the time that he worked with me. He is both very bright and highly professional. I am confident that he will display a high degree of commitment and discharge his job duties and responsibilities with diligence in your organisation. He is a fast learner and has shown the ability to absorb large volumes of information. Mr. Naresh has demonstrated the ability to beautifully express information and ideas in both written and verbal forms.

          Naresh has been successful in his efforts to engage the media in our outreach program. He has been able to convince editors to publish his exciting press releases and articles in their publications. Mr. Naresh is willing to take risks and does not shy away from putting in extra hours of work. He is outgoing and willing to reach out to people and involve them with projects. I particularly appreciate his team spirit and willingness to help the office serve its stakeholders in a better manner.
